# Conn: D-Sub Breakout Board

## info

Simple breakout for DA-15, DB/DE-9 & DE-15(VGA) connectors. DB-9 to be placed on DA-15 footprint.

This board provides a simple breakout for three common D-sub connectors: **DA-15**, **DE-9 (commonly referred to as DB-9)**, and **DE-15 (VGA)**. It breaks out each pin to a labeled 0.1" header for prototyping and development use. Key features:

- **Supported Connectors**: DA-15, DE-9 (lower 9 pins), and DE-15 (VGA).
- **Universal Footprint**: Designed around a 15-pin D-sub footprint with compatible mounting and pin spacing for all three types.
- **Shield Grounding**: Two 2Ã—1 headers are provided to connect the connector shield to breadboard ground rails for EMC and mechanical stability.
- **Mechanical Compatibility**: A secondary shield mounting point can be drilled out to support DE-9 connectors using existing unused copper-free areas.

All connectors are through-hole and positioned for direct breadboard compatibility.
